# python-game
This is how I relax myself.

# Note
This "game" has no any visual thing. It's more like a consol game =)

# Current targets:
- At least 10 monsters, 5 places, 15 items
- Looting/chance system.
- More dynamic menu.
- Balanced fights.

# Next targets:
- Upgrading system.
- Neat skill system.
- Threading implementation. (If I need.)

# Very next targets:
- Story!!

# More notes:
Currently, I'm working on it in my free time (I have no very much free time though). 
I'll develop it until I satisfied.

Yes.
