# python-game
This is how I relax myself.

# Note
This "game" has no any visual thing. It's more like a consol game =)
I do not use kanban or anything else, I'll use README to tracking
bugs and other things. Bugs will be named B1, B2, B3... =)

# Current targets:
- At least 10 monsters (Done), 5 places (Done), 15 items

Currently, I'm working on it in my free time (I have no very much free time though). 
I'll develop it until I satisfied.

Yes.

# Bugs:
B1:
When you choose a place to travel and this place's requirement level
is higher than your level, it'll change the location to Town but
after that, If you type the monster ID in the unpermitted place,
fight begins with that monster.
