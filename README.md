# python-game
This is how I relax myself.

# Note
This "game" has no any visual thing. It's more like a "terminal game".

# Current targets:
- At least 10 monsters (Done), 5 places (Done), 15 items
- Looting/chance system. (money system)
- More dynamic menu. (%76.7 done)
- Balanced fights. (I think It's more balanced now.)

# Next targets:
- Upgrading system.
- Neat skill system. (Started, and maybe It'll be not as neat as I think.)
- Threading implementation. (If I need.) (Probably, I won't need it.)

# Very next targets:
- Story!! (This is hard.)

# More notes:
Currently, I'm working on it in my free time (I have no very much free time though). 
I'll develop it until I satisfied.

Yes.
